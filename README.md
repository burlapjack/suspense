# Suspense Parade - C++ Linux Terminal Game

This project was started by a complete newbie for the sake of learning how to program in C++.  For the most part,  every file has been written using a Raspberry PI 3 Model B within a Raspbian terminal.

Suspense Parade requires the use of the Ncurses library for input management and character highlighting.  

xpm files are used frequently throughout the program as splash screen bitmaps.  They have been modified to work with std::string instead of char\*.
